This repository contains a data set which is diabetes_csv.csv prepared for the use of implementations of machine learning algorithms.
In the funchion.py file there are 2 method to determine regression line.One of the method includes Least Square
Solution which has plotting line section inside as well.Other method  is RANSAC algorithm
which finding best regression line for our problem. Also the final line found in RANSAC solution is saved inside the final.png.
Other 2 png file figure_0.png and figure_1.png just the example steps of RANSAC iterations.

Also,in computeRmse function calculate the root mean squre errors between the true values and predicted y values for RANSAC and
Least squared solution respectively.I used only the first 50 sample of data in order the test my functions performance.

In the gradientDescent.py Logistic Regression implemented by using Gradient Descent with Python.Linear regression predicts
the value of a continuous dependent variable. Whereas logistic regression predicts the probability of an event or class that is dependent on other factors.
Thus the output of logistic regression always lies between 0 and 1.In our case 0 defined as diabetes test
is negative and 1 defined as test is positive.Then it is used for classification purpose.
